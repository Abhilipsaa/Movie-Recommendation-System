# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using the MovieLens dataset. The goal is to provide users with personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences and viewing history.
The recommendation system employs collaborative filtering techniques, specifically item-based collaborative filtering using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

Why Do We Need Recommender Systems?

In the era of information abundance, recommender systems play a crucial role in helping users discover content they are likely to enjoy.
Whether it's movies, videos, or products, recommender systems alleviate the overwhelming choices users face by providing personalized suggestions based on their preferences.

Types of Recommendation Engines

There are two main types of recommendation engines:
Content-based filtering and Collaborative filtering. This project focuses on Collaborative Filtering, specifically Item-based Collaborative Filtering using the KNN algorithm.

User-based Collaborative Filtering: Identifies users with similar preferences.

Item-based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items similar to those the user has shown interest in.

Dataset
To experiment with recommendation algorithms, the MovieLens dataset is used. It contains information about movies, user ratings, and genres.
